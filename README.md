# Team Profile Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a command line application that accepts user input to generate an HTML page that display's the user's manager and then gives the user the opprotunity to add an intern or an engineer to the project.

## Description 
The prompts had to pass a series of tests to ensure the application would run correctly. Once the tests were all passed, I had to write code to generate the HTML page that would accept the user input and display it to the page. This project is powered by node, jest, and Javascript.
